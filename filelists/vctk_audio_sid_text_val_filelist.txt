VCTK/wav/p335/p335_058.wav|49|Let's see that increase over the years.
VCTK/wav/p236/p236_225.wav|75|There is no quick fix.
VCTK/wav/p374/p374_353.wav|11|And that brings us to the point.

VCTK/wav/p265/p265_063.wav|73|IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
VCTK/wav/p314/p314_042.wav|51|It is all about people being assaulted, abused.
VCTK/wav/p241/p241_188.wav|86|I wish I could say something.

VCTK/wav/p228/p228_187.wav|57|They will run a mile.
VCTK/wav/p294/p294_317.wav|104|It didn't put me off.
VCTK/wav/p231/p231_445.wav|50|It sounded like a bomb.
VCTK/wav/p272/p272_086.wav|69|Today she has been released.
VCTK/wav/p255/p255_210.wav|31|It was worth a photograph.

VCTK/wav/p307/p307_037.wav|22|He released a half-dozen solo albums.
VCTK/wav/p305/p305_185.wav|54|I am not even thinking about that.

VCTK/wav/p278/p278_255.wav|10|They made such decisions in London.
VCTK/wav/p361/p361_132.wav|79|That got me out.
VCTK/wav/p307/p307_146.wav|22|You hope he prevails.
VCTK/wav/p244/p244_147.wav|78|They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
VCTK/wav/p294/p294_283.wav|104|This is our unfinished business.
VCTK/wav/p283/p283_300.wav|95|I would have the hammer in the crowd.

VCTK/wav/p300/p300_169.wav|102|Who do these people think they are?
VCTK/wav/p276/p276_177.wav|106|They exist in name alone.
VCTK/wav/p228/p228_245.wav|57|It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
VCTK/wav/p300/p300_303.wav|102|I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
VCTK/wav/p362/p362_247.wav|15|This would give Scotland around eight members.
VCTK/wav/p326/p326_031.wav|28|United were in control without always being dominant.
VCTK/wav/p361/p361_288.wav|79|I did not think it was very proper.
VCTK/wav/p286/p286_145.wav|63|Tiger is not the norm.

VCTK/wav/p226/p226_268.wav|43|That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
VCTK/wav/p362/p362_314.wav|15|Is that right?
VCTK/wav/p240/p240_047.wav|93|It is so sad.
VCTK/wav/p250/p250_207.wav|24|You could feel the heat.
VCTK/wav/p273/p273_176.wav|56|Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
VCTK/wav/p316/p316_147.wav|85|And frankly, it's been a while.
VCTK/wav/p265/p265_047.wav|73|It is unique.
VCTK/wav/p336/p336_353.wav|98|Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
VCTK/wav/p230/p230_376.wav|35|This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
VCTK/wav/p308/p308_209.wav|107|There is great potential on this river.
VCTK/wav/p250/p250_442.wav|24|We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
VCTK/wav/p260/p260_037.wav|81|It's a fact.

VCTK/wav/p247/p247_225.wav|14|I am considered a teenager.)
VCTK/wav/p294/p294_094.wav|104|It should be a condition of employment.
VCTK/wav/p269/p269_031.wav|94|Is this accurate?
VCTK/wav/p275/p275_116.wav|40|It's not fair.
VCTK/wav/p265/p265_006.wav|73|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
VCTK/wav/p285/p285_072.wav|2|Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
VCTK/wav/p270/p270_167.wav|8|We did what we had to do.
